# MuseApi

This is the API server for a prototype project I was working on before I hit a hard stopping point due to a YouTube limitation.

The idea was that a user could generate YouTube playlists from their Spotify songs/playlists. Unfortunately, YouTube is very strict on their API quotas, and it would not have been feasible to implement this integration.

Thus, I'm making the src code public as it still contains great examples of Angular9 and NestJS usage and patterns.
